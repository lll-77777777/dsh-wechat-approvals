 * Durable state for the channel: credentials, the long-poll cursor, and the

 * Three things must survive a process restart:
 *
 * - **Credentials.** A bot token is long-lived; re-scanning on every boot would be
 *   unacceptable and, worse, would re-bind the account.
 * - **The poll cursor** (`get_updates_buf`). The server treats it as an incremental
 *   cursor, so dropping it loses whatever arrived while the process was down.
 * - **`context_token`s.** Issued per inbound message and required verbatim on the
 *   reply. The official client persists them per account and per peer for exactly
 *   this reason.
 *
 * Writes are atomic (temp file plus rename) so a crash cannot leave a half-written
 * credential file that locks the user out of their own bot.
